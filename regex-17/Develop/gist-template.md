### Anchors
    The begining of the string is identified by the caret ```^``` and the end of the string is identified by the dollar sign ```$```
### Quantifiers
    ```+``` is used to communicate there is another sequence to be matched as a greedy quantifier. ```{2,6}``` is another greedy quantifer used to specify the input that there should be a minimum of 2 characrtors to a maximum of 6 characters.

### OR Operator
    The begining of the string is identified by the caret ```^``` and the end of the string is identified by the dollar sign ```$```
